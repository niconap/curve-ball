# GGBall

## Environment installation

This code was tested with PyTorch 2.0.1, cuda 11.8 and torch\_geometrics 2.3.1

* Download anaconda/miniconda if needed

* Create a rdkit environment that directly contains rdkit:

  `conda create -c conda-forge -n ggball rdkit=2023.03.2 python=3.9`

* `conda activate ggball`

* Check that this line does not return an error:

  `python3 -c 'from rdkit import Chem'`

* Install graph-tool (https://graph-tool.skewed.de/):

  `conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool=2.45`

* Check that this line does not return an error:

  `python3 -c 'import graph_tool as gt' `

* Install the nvcc drivers for your cuda version. For example:

  `conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda`

* Install a corresponding version of pytorch, for example:

  `pip3 install torch==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`

* Install other packages using the requirement file:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Install Geoopt:

  `pip install geoopt`

* Install pyg:

  ''' pip install pyg\_lib torch\_scatter torch\_sparse torch\_cluster torch\_spline\_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.0.1+cu118.html'''

* Run:

  `pip install -e .`

* Navigate to the ./analysis/orca directory and compile orca.cpp:

  `g++ -O2 -std=c++11 -o orca orca.cpp`

Note: graph\_tool and torch\_geometric currently seem to conflict on MacOS, I have not solved this issue yet.

## Run the code

* All code about HAE or HVQVAE is currently launched through `python3 main.py`. Check hydra documentation (https://hydra.cc/) for overriding default parameters.
* To run the debugging code: `python3 main.py dataset.debug=true`. We advise to try to run the debug mode first
  before launching full experiments.
* To run a code with poincare flow matching: `python3 train_flow.py`.
* You can specify the dataset with `python3 main.py dataset=ego_small`. Look at `configs/dataset` for the list
  of datasets that are currently available

## Generated samples

We provide the generated samples for some of the models. If you have retrained a model from scratch for which the samples are
not available yet, we would be very happy if you could send them to us!

## Troubleshooting

`PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: './GGBall/analysis/orca/orca'`: You probably did not compile orca.
